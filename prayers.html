        <h2>The Nicene Creed</h2>

      <article>
        <p class="code"> We believe in one God,
          the Father, the Almighty,
          Maker of all that is, seen and unseen.

          We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
          the only Son of God,
          eternally begotten of the Father,
          God from God, Light from Light,
          true God from true God,
          begotten, not made, consubstantial
          of one Being with the Father.

          Through Him all things were made.
          For us men and for our salvation
          He came down from heaven,
          and by the Holy Spirit
          was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
          and became man.

          For our sake He was crucified
          under Pontius Pilate;
          he suffered death and was buried.

          On the third day He rose again
          in accordance with the Scriptures;
          He ascended into heaven
          and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

          He will come again in glory
          to judge the living and the dead,
          and His kingdom will have no end.

          We believe in the Holy Spirit,
          the Lord, the giver of life,
          Who proceeds from the Father and the Son.
          With the Father and the Son
          He is worshipped and glorified.
          He has spoken through the Prophets.

          We believe in one holy catholic
          and apostolic Church.
          We acknowledge one baptism
          for the forgiveness of sins.
          We look for the resurrection of the dead,
          and the life of the world to come.

          Amen.

        <h2>Optional Prayer to Saint Joseph</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This prayer to Saint Joseph â€” spouse of the Virgin Mary, foster father of Jesus, and patron saint of the
          universal Church â€” was composed by Pope Leo XIII in his 1889 encyclical, Quamquam Pluries. He asked that it be
          added to the end of the Rosary, especially during the month of October, which is dedicated to the Rosary. The
          prayer is enriched with a partial indulgence (Handbook of Indulgences, conc. 19), and may be said after the
          customary Salve Regina and concluding prayer. It may also be used to conclude other Marian devotions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Prayer</h3>
        <p class="code">To you, O blessed Joseph,
          do we come in our tribulation,
          and having implored the help
          of your most holy Spouse,
          we confidently invoke your patronage also.

          Through that charity which bound you
          to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God
          and through the paternal love with
          which you embraced the Child Jesus,
          we humbly beg you graciously
          to regard the inheritance which Jesus Christ
          has purchased by his Blood,
          and with your power and strength
          to aid us in our necessities.

          O most watchful guardian
          of the Holy Family,
          defend the chosen children
          of Jesus Christ; O most loving father,
          ward off from us every contagion of error
          and corrupting influence;
          O our most mighty protector,
          be kind to us and from heaven
          assist us in our struggle
          with the power of darkness.

          As once you rescued the Child Jesus
          from deadly peril so now protect
          God's Holy Church from the snares
          of the enemy and from all adversity;
          shield, too, each one of us
          by your constant protection,
          so that, supported by your example
          and your aid, we may
          be able to live piously,
          to die in holiness,
          and to obtain eternal
          happiness in heaven.

          Amen.

        <p>
          O Jesus, our most loving Savior who deigned to come in to the world from heaven not only to enlighten it by
          teaching and by Your example, and to save it by death, but also to spend the greater part of life in humble
          obedience to Mary and Joseph in the obscurity of Nazareth, thus sanctifying the home which was to be the model
          of all Christian homes: graciously receive this family which consecrates itself to you this day. Protect us
          and maintain in us all through life Your holy fear and love, and true harmony and charity among ourselves, so
          that we imitate Your Holy Family, be one in heart and soul on earth and obtain eternal happiness and glory
          with You in heaven.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          O Mary, loving Mother of Jesus and our Mother, by your merciful intercession deign to make this humble
          dedication acceptable to Jesus Christ so that we may obtain His grace to be a truly Christian family.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          St. Joseph, guardian and supporter of Jesus and Mary, help us with your powerful prayers in all our corporal
          and spiritual needs, and especially at the hour of our death, so that we may be one day all united in heaven
          with you to praise and love Jesus and Mary forever and ever.
