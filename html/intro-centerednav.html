      <p>
        The Rosary is one of the most powerful sacramentals of the Catholic Church originating in the early centuries
        of Christianity, once called "Mary's Psalter". The rosary as we know it today was given by the Blessed Virgin
        Mary to St. Dominic de Guzman, founder of the Dominican Order, in the 12th century as an efficacious prayer
        and spiritual weapon for the salvation of souls. Whenever the prayers are said on the rosary beads, the
        intercession of the Blessed Mother is invoked for the intentions we hold in our hearts. The rosary has been
        recommended as a spiritual necessity by numerous saints and Popes ever since.

        The Rosary is divided into five groups of ten beads called decades (or chaplets). As we pray the rosary we
        meditate on the events of Our Lord's life and Passion, which are called Mysteries. The repetition of the
        prayers assists in this prayerful meditation. The rosary, in essence, is a compendium of the Gospel and leads
        us, through the intercession of Our Lady, to contemplate Jesus Christ.

        The Rosary can be said privately or with a group.
