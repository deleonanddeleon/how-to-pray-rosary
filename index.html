        <p>
          The Rosary is one of the most powerful sacramentals of the Catholic Church originating in the early centuries
          of Christianity, once called "Mary's Psalter". The rosary as we know it today was given by the Blessed Virgin
          Mary to St. Dominic de Guzman, founder of the Dominican Order, in the 12th century as an efficacious prayer
          and spiritual weapon for the salvation of souls. Whenever the prayers are said on the rosary beads, the
          intercession of the Blessed Mother is invoked for the intentions we hold in our hearts. The rosary has been
          recommended as a spiritual necessity by numerous saints and Popes ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Rosary is divided into five groups of ten beads called decades (or chaplets). As we pray the rosary we
          meditate on the events of Our Lord's life and Passion, which are called Mysteries. The repetition of the
          prayers assists in this prayerful meditation. The rosary, in essence, is a compendium of the Gospel and leads
          us, through the intercession of Our Lady, to contemplate Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Rosary can be said privately or with a group.

        <h2>Prayer To Saint Joseph</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This prayer to Saint Joseph—spouse of the Virgin Mary, foster father of Jesus, and patron saint of the
          universal Church—was composed by Pope Leo XIII in his 1889 encyclical, Quamquam Pluries. He asked that it be
          added to the end of the Rosary, especially during the month of October, which is dedicated to the Rosary. The
          prayer is enriched with a partial indulgence (Handbook of Indulgences, conc. 19), and may be said after the
          customary Salve Regina and concluding prayer. It may also be used to conclude other Marian devotions.
        </p>
        <h3>Prayer</h3>
        <code>
          To you, O blessed Joseph,<br>
          do we come in our tribulation,<br>
          and having implored the help of your most holy Spouse,<br>
          we confidently invoke your patronage also.<br>
          <br>
          Through that charity which bound you<br>
          to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God<br>
          and through the paternal love<br>
          with which you embraced the Child Jesus,<br>
          we humbly beg you graciously to regard the inheritance<br>
          which Jesus Christ has purchased by his Blood,<br>
          and with your power and strength to aid us in our necessities.<br>
          <br>
          O most watchful guardian of the Holy Family,<br>
          defend the chosen children of Jesus Christ;<br>
          O most loving father, ward off from us<br>
          every contagion of error and corrupting influence;<br>
          O our most mighty protector, be kind to us<br>
          and from heaven assist us in our struggle<br>
          with the power of darkness.<br>
          <br>
          As once you rescued the Child Jesus from deadly peril,<br>
          so now protect God's Holy Church<br>
          from the snares of the enemy and from all adversity;<br>
          shield, too, each one of us by your constant protection,<br>
          so that, supported by your example and your aid,<br>
          we may be able to live piously, to die in holiness,<br>
          and to obtain eternal happiness in heaven.<br>
          <br>

        <h2>Details on The Mysteries</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The Mysteries of the Rosary are designed to help focus our prayer on the life, ministry, and Passion of Our
          Lord. Pope Pius XII described the rosary prayer as "the compendium of the entire Gospel." There are four
          rosary mysteries (Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious, Luminous) and five parts of each mystery which correspond to
          the five decades of the rosary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Joyful Mysteries focus on the joyful events related to the Incarnation of Jesus Christ. The Sorrowful
          Mysteries focus on the sorrowful events related to the Passion and Death of Jesus Christ. The Glorious
          Mysteries focus on the glorious events related to the Resurrection and the reigning of Christ in heaven with
          Our Lady. The Luminous Mysteries or mysteries of light (added by Pope St. John Paul II) focus on the life and
          ministry of Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is recommended that you meditate on the mysteries of the rosary based upon the days of the week. For
          example, on Mondays you will pray the Joyful Mysteries. With each of the five decades of the rosary you will
          focus on one of the five events that comprise the Joyful mysteries. On Tuesday you will pray the Sorrowful
          Mysteries, and so on through the rest of the week. This method was recommended to the faithful by Pope St.
          John Paul II.
