        <p>
          The Rosary is one of the most powerful sacramentals of the Catholic Church originating in the early centuries
          of Christianity, once called "Mary's Psalter". The rosary as we know it today was given by the Blessed Virgin
          Mary to St. Dominic de Guzman, founder of the Dominican Order, in the 12th century as an efficacious prayer
          and spiritual weapon for the salvation of souls. Whenever the prayers are said on the rosary beads, the
          intercession of the Blessed Mother is invoked for the intentions we hold in our hearts. The rosary has been
          recommended as a spiritual necessity by numerous saints and Popes ever since.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Rosary is divided into five groups of ten beads called decades (or chaplets). As we pray the rosary we
          meditate on the events of Our Lord's life and Passion, which are called Mysteries. The repetition of the
          prayers assists in this prayerful meditation. The rosary, in essence, is a compendium of the Gospel and leads
          us, through the intercession of Our Lady, to contemplate Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Rosary can be said privately or with a group.

        <p class="code"> We believe in one God,
          the Father, the Almighty,
          Maker of all that is, seen and unseen.

          We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
          the only Son of God,
          eternally begotten of the Father,
          God from God, Light from Light,
          true God from true God,
          begotten, not made, consubstantial
          of one Being with the Father.

          Through him all things were made.
          For us men and for our salvation
          he came down from heaven,
          and by the Holy Spirit
          was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
          and became man.

          For our sake he was crucified
          under Pontius Pilate;
          he suffered death and was buried.

          On the third day he rose again
          in accordance with the Scriptures;
          he ascended into heaven
          and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

          He will come again in glory
          to judge the living and the dead,
          and His kingdom will have no end.

          We believe in the Holy Spirit,
          the Lord, the giver of life,
          Who proceeds from the Father and the Son.
          With the Father and the Son
          He is worshipped and glorified.
          He has spoken through the Prophets.

          We believe in one holy catholic
          and apostolic Church.
          We acknowledge one baptism
          for the forgiveness of sins.
          We look for the resurrection of the dead,
          and the life of the world to come.

          <li>The <span class="bold-light">Baptism of Christ in the Jordan</span>
            <p><span class="code-italic">In those days, Jesus came from <br>
                Nazareth in Galilee and was <br>
                baptized by John in the Jordan. <br>
                Immediately coming up out of the <br>
                water, He saw the heavens <br>
                opening, and the Spirit like a dove <br>
                descending upon Him; and a voice <br>
                came out of the heavens: <br>
                "You are My beloved Son <br>
                in You I am well-pleased." <br>

          <li>The <span class="bold-light">Wedding Feast at Cana</span>
            <p><span class="code-italic">On the third day, there was a <br>
                wedding in Cana of Galilee, <br>
                and the mother of Jesus was there; <br>
                and both Jesus and His disciples <br>
                were invited to the wedding. When <br>
                the wine ran out, the mother of <br>
                Jesus said to Him, "They have <br>
                no wine." And Jesus said to her <br>
                "Woman, what does that have to <br>
                do with us? My hour has not yet <br>
                come." His mother said to the <br>
                servants, "Whatever He says to <br>
                you, do it." ... and manifested His <br>
                glory, and His disciples believed in Him. <br>

          <li>The <span class="bold-light">Proclamation of the Coming of the Kingdom of God</span>
            <p><span class="code-italic">Jesus was going throughout all <br>
                Galilee, teaching in their synagogues <br>
                and proclaiming the gospel of the <br>
                kingdom, and heading every kind <br>
                of disease and every kind of <br>
                sickness among the people. <br>
                ... Large crowds followed Him <br>
                from Galilee and the Decapolis and <br>
                Jerusalem and Judea, and from <br>
                beyond the Jordan. <br>

                His brother, and led them high up on <br>
                a high mountain by themselves. <br>
                And He was transfigured before <br>
                them; and His face shone like <br>
                the sun, and His garments <br>
                became as white as light. <br>
                And behold, Moses and Elijah <br>
                appeared to them, talking with Him. <br>
                (Matthew 17, 1-3)</span></p>

            <p><span class="code-italic">When the hour ahd come, <br>
                He reclined at the the table, <br>
                and the Apostles with Him. <br>
                And He said to them, "I have <br>
                earnestly desired to eat this <br>
                Passover with you before I suffer; <br>
                for I say to you, I shall never <br>
                again eat it until it is fulfilled <br>
                in the kingdom of God." <br>

        <h2>Optional Prayer to Saint Joseph</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This prayer to Saint Joseph — spouse of the Virgin Mary, foster father of Jesus, and patron saint of the
          universal Church — was composed by Pope Leo XIII in his 1889 encyclical, Quamquam Pluries. He asked that it be
          added to the end of the Rosary, especially during the month of October, which is dedicated to the Rosary. The
          prayer is enriched with a partial indulgence (Handbook of Indulgences, conc. 19), and may be said after the
          customary Salve Regina and concluding prayer. It may also be used to conclude other Marian devotions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Prayer</h3>
        <p class="code">To you, O blessed Joseph,
          do we come in our tribulation,
          and having implored the help
          of your most holy Spouse,
          we confidently invoke your patronage also.

          Through that charity which bound you
          to the Immaculate Virgin Mother of God
          and through the paternal love with
          which you embraced the Child Jesus,
          we humbly beg you graciously
          to regard the inheritance which Jesus Christ
          has purchased by his Blood,
          and with your power and strength
          to aid us in our necessities.

          O most watchful guardian
          of the Holy Family,
          defend the chosen children
          of Jesus Christ; O most loving father,
          ward off from us every contagion of error
          and corrupting influence;
          O our most mighty protector,
          be kind to us and from heaven
          assist us in our struggle
          with the power of darkness.

          As once you rescued the Child Jesus
          from deadly peril so now protect
          God's Holy Church from the snares
          of the enemy and from all adversity;
          shield, too, each one of us
          by your constant protection,
          so that, supported by your example
          and your aid, we may
          be able to live piously,
          to die in holiness,
          and to obtain eternal
          happiness in heaven.

          Amen.

        <h2>Details on The Mysteries</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p>
          The Mysteries of the Rosary are designed to help focus our prayer on the life, ministry, and Passion of Our
          Lord. Pope Pius XII described the rosary prayer as "the compendium of the entire Gospel." There are four
          rosary mysteries (Joyful, Sorrowful, Glorious, Luminous) and five parts of each mystery which correspond to
          the five decades of the rosary.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Joyful Mysteries focus on the joyful events related to the Incarnation of Jesus Christ. The Sorrowful
          Mysteries focus on the sorrowful events related to the Passion and Death of Jesus Christ. The Glorious
          Mysteries focus on the glorious events related to the Resurrection and the reigning of Christ in heaven with
          Our Lady. The Luminous Mysteries or mysteries of light (added by Pope St. John Paul II) focus on the life and
          ministry of Jesus Christ.

          It is recommended that you meditate on the mysteries of the rosary based upon the days of the week. For
          example, on Mondays you will pray the Joyful Mysteries. With each of the five decades of the rosary you will
          focus on one of the five events that comprise the Joyful mysteries. On Tuesday you will pray the Sorrowful
          Mysteries, and so on through the rest of the week. This method was recommended to the faithful by Pope St.
          John Paul II.

          The first five decades, the "joyful mysteries", are marked by the joy radiating from the event of the
          Incarnation ...

        <br>
        <p>
          ... To medidtate upon the "joyful" mysteries, then, is to enter into the ultimate causes of the Incarnation
          and the deepest meaning of Christian joy.

          It is to focus on the realism of the mystery of the Incarnation and on the obscure foreshadowing of the
          mystery of the saving Passion. Mary leads us to discover the secret of Christian joy, reminding us that
          Christianity is, first and foremost, evangelion, "good news", which has as its heart and its whole content the
          person of Jesus Christ, the Word made flesh, the one Saviour of the world.

          The Gospels give great prominence to the sorrowful mysteries of Christ. From the beginning, Christian piety,
          especially during the Lenten devotion of the Way of the Cross, has focused on the individual moements of the
          Passion, realizing that here is found the culmination of the revelation of God's love and the source of our
          salvation. The Rosay selects certain moments from the Passion, inviting the faithful to contemplate them in
          their hearts and to relive them. The sequence of meditations begins with Gethsemane, where Christ experiences
          a moment of great anguish before the will of the Father, against which the weakness of the flesh would be
          tempted to rebel. There, Jesus encounters all the temptations, and confronts all the sins of humanity, in
          order to say to the Father: "Not my will but Yours be done" (Luke 22:42 and parallels). This "Yes" of Christ
          reverses the "No" of our first parents in the Garden of Eden. And the cost of this faithfulness to the
          Father's will is amde clear in the following mysteries; by His scourging His crowning with thorns, His
          carrying the Cross and His death on the Cross, the Lord cast into the most abject suffering. Ecce homo! This
          abject suffering reveals not only the love of God, but also the meaning of man himself. Ecce homo: the
          meaning, origin and fulfillment of man is to be found in Christ, the God who humbles Himself out of love "even
          unto death, death on a cross" (Phil 2:8). The sorrowful mysteries help the believer to relive the death of
          Jesus, to stand at the foot of the Cross beside Mary, to enter with her into the depths of God's love for man
          and to experience all its life-giving power.

          "The contemplation of Christ's face cannot stop at the image of the Crucified One. He is the Risen One!" The
          Rosary has always expressed this knowledge born of faith and invited the believer to pass beyond the darkeness
          of the Passion in order to gaze upon Christ's glory in the Resurrection and Ascension, Contemplating the Risen
          One, Christian rediscover the reasons for their own faith (cf. 1Cor 15:14) and relive the joy not only of
          those to whom Christ appeared - the Apostles, Mary Magdalene, and the disciples on the road to Emmaus - but
          also the joy of Mary, who must have had an equally intense experience of the new life of her glorified Son. In
          the Ascension, Christ was raised in glory to the right hand of the Father, while Mary herself would be raised
          to that same glory in the Assumption, enjoying beforehand, by a unique privilege, the destiny reserved for all
          the just at the resurrection of the dead. Crowned in glory - as she appears in the last glorious mystery -
          Mary shines forth as Queen of the Angels and Saints, the anticpation and the supreme realiation of the
          eschatological state of the Church.

          At the center of this unfolding sequence of the glory of the Son and the Mother, the Rosary sets before us the
          third glorious mystery, Pentecost, which reveals the face of the Church as a family gathered together with
          Mary, enlivended by the powerful outpouring of the Spirit and ready for the mission of evangelization. The
          contemplation of this scene, like that of the other glorious mysteries, ought to lead the faithful to an ever
          greater appreciation of their new life in Christ, lived in the heart of the Church, a life of which the scene
          of Pentecost istself is the great "icon"...

        <span class="bold-light">The Mysteries of Light</span>
        <p>
          Moving on from the infancy and the hidden life in Nazareth to the public life of Jesus, our contemplation
          brings us to those mysteries which may be called in a special way "mysteries of light". Certainly the whole
          mystery of Christ is a mystery of light. He is the "light of the world" (John 8:12). Yet this truth emerges in
          a special way during the years of His public life, when He proclaims the Gospel of the Kingdom. In proposing
          to the Christian community five significant moments - "luminous mysteries" - during this phase of Christ's
          life, I think that the follwoing can be fittingly singled out: (1) His Baptism in the Jordan, (2) His
          self-manifestation at the wedding at Cana, (3) His proclamation of the Kingdom of God, with His call to
          conversion, (4) His Transfiguration, and finally, (5) His institution of the Eucharist, as the sacramental
          expression of the Paschal Mystery...
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          ... In these mysteries, apart from the miracle at Cana, the presence of Mary remains in the background. The
          Gospels make only the briefest reference to her occasional presence at one momemnt or other during the
          preaching of Jesus (cf. Mark 3:31-5; John 2:12), and they give no indication that she was present at the Last
          Supper and the institution of the Eucharist. Yet the role she assumed at Cana in some way accompanies Christ
          throughout His ministry. The revelation made directly by the Father at the Baptism in the Jordan and echoed by
          John the Baptist is placed upon Mary's lips at Cana, and it becomes the great material counsel which Mary
          addresses to the Church of every age: "Do whatever He tells you" (John 2:5). This counsel is a fitting
          introduction to the words and signs of Christ's public ministry, and it forms the Marian foundation of all the
          "mysteries of light".
