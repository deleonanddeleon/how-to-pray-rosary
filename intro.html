      <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          The Rosary is one of the most powerful sacramentals of the Catholic Church originating in the early centuries
          of Christianity, once called "Mary's Psalter". The rosary as we know it today was given by the Blessed Virgin
          Mary to St. Dominic de Guzman, founder of the Dominican Order, in the 12th century as an efficacious prayer
          and spiritual weapon for the salvation of souls. Whenever the prayers are said on the rosary beads, the
          intercession of the Blessed Mother is invoked for the intentions we hold in our hearts. The rosary has been
          recommended as a spiritual necessity by numerous saints and Popes ever since.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Rosary is divided into five groups of ten beads called decades (or chaplets). As we pray the rosary we
          meditate on the events of Our Lord's life and Passion, which are called Mysteries. The repetition of the
          prayers assists in this prayerful meditation. The rosary, in essence, is a compendium of the Gospel and leads
          us, through the intercession of Our Lady, to contemplate Jesus Christ.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Rosary can be said privately or with a group.
