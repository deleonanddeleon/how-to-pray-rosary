            I believe in God,
            The Father Almighty,
            Creator of heaven and earth,
            And in Jesus Christ,
            His only Son, our Lord,
            Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
            Born of the Virgin Mary,
            Suffered under Pontius Pilate,
            Was crucified, died and was buried;
            He descended into hell;
            On the third day He rose again from the dead;
            He ascended into heaven,
            And is seated at the right hand
            Of God the Father Almighty;
            From there He will come
            To judge the living and the dead.
            I believe in the Holy Spirit,
            The holy catholic Church,
            The communion of saints,
            The forgiveness of sins,
            The resurrection of the body,
            And life everlasting.

          O Jesus, our most loving Savior who deigned to come in to the world from heaven not only to enlighten it by
          teaching and by Your example, and to save it by death, but also to spend the greater part of life in humble
          obedience to Mary and Joseph in the obscurity of Nazareth, thus sanctifying the home which was to be the model
          of all Christian homes: graciously receive this family which consecrates itself to you this day. Protect us
          and maintain in us all through life Your holy fear and love, and true harmony and charity among ourselves, so
          that we imitate Your Holy Family, be one in heart and soul on earth and obtain eternal happiness and glory
          with You in heaven.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          O Mary, loving Mother of Jesus and our Mother, by your merciful intercession deign to make this humble
          dedication acceptable to Jesus Christ so that we may obtain His grace to be a truly Christian family.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          St. Joseph, guardian and supporter of Jesus and Mary, help us with your powerful prayers in all our corporal
          and spiritual needs, and especially at the hour of our death, so that we may be one day all united in heaven
          with you to praise and love Jesus and Mary forever and ever.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Nicene Creed</h2>
      </header>
      <article>
        <p class="code"> We believe in one God,
          the Father, the Almighty,
          Maker of all that is, seen and unseen.

          We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ,
          the only Son of God,
          eternally begotten of the Father,
          God from God, Light from Light,
          true God from true God,
          begotten, not made, consubstantial
          of one Being with the Father.

          Through Him all things were made.
          For us men and for our salvation
          He came down from heaven,
          and by the Holy Spirit
          was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
          and became man.

          For our sake He was crucified
          under Pontius Pilate;
          he suffered death and was buried.

          On the third day He rose again
          in accordance with the Scriptures;
          He ascended into heaven
          and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

          He will come again in glory
          to judge the living and the dead,
          and His kingdom will have no end.

          We believe in the Holy Spirit,
          the Lord, the giver of life,
          Who proceeds from the Father and the Son.
          With the Father and the Son
          He is worshipped and glorified.
          He has spoken through the Prophets.

          We believe in one holy catholic
          and apostolic Church.
          We acknowledge one baptism
          for the forgiveness of sins.
          We look for the resurrection of the dead,
          and the life of the world to come.

          Amen.
